Introduction
The Diabetic Comprehensive Health Risk Assessment system utilizes health data and machine learning algorithms to predict the risks associated with diabetes. 
By inputting health parameters such as blood sugar levels, BMI, family history, and lifestyle habits, 
this application provides insights and suggestions to help manage diabetes effectively.

This project involves:
1.Data preprocessing
2.Model development (classification/regression)
3.Risk assessment predictions
4.User interface for data entry and result visualization

Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

1.Python 3.6 or above
2.pip (Python package manager)
3.For using machine learning models, ensure the following libraries are installed:
4.numpy
5.pandas
6.scikit-learn
7.tensorflow / keras (depending on your model)
8.streamlit (for UI, if applicable)
9.matplotlib / seaborn (for data visualization)
10.Flask or FastAPI (for serving models via API, if applicable)

Installation
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/hamna321/AI-Project-.git
cd diabetic-health-risk-assessment

2. Set up a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Running the Model:
To train or use the risk assessment model:
python train_model.py   # Or, if you have a specific script for inference

Running the Application:
To start the streamlit app:
1.!pip install streamlit -q
2.!wget -qO- ipv4.icanhazip.com
3.!streamlit run app.py & npx localtunnel --port 8501
